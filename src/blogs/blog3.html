                    If you’re here, it means curiosity got the best of you. Don’t feel bad. Humans are naturally curious creatures. We (instructors) can use human curiosity to our advantage when it comes to training responders, team leaders, department heads and anyone else that needs to be situationally aware (which would be ALL of us, right?). Appeal to curiosity. Use the element of surprise to get students interested in your message.

                    When the message is boring and redundant, the listener tunes out. If the title is interesting and the message is presented in a new way, maybe even an unusual way, it can be a powerful tool to attract and keep someone’s interest.

                    Recently, I took my three sons golfing. While on the course, I had an encounter that inspired me to write an article that I published on Firehouse.com website titled: Groundbreaking research reveals link between golfing and firefighter safety.

                    here was nothing groundbreaking about what happened and it would be a wide stretch to call it research. But, nonetheless, there was a situational awareness message contained within the satirical contribution and as anyone who attends one of my programs can attest to, I am not above doing ANYTHING to get my message seared into the minds of students.
